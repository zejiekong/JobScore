What's in it for me?\n\nIn addition to the reasons for joining in ExpressVPN in general, here are some key reasons for Engineers in particular:\n\nThe people. We like to think that you'll find them open and friendly, skilled and motivated, and unified by our mission to protect the privacy and security of millions of customers world-wide.\nImpact. Deliver with both high pace and great quality. You don't need to convince people here to invest in good engineering practices.\nSkill growth. We cover a broad range of engineering specialties: many aspects of high-scale cloud applications, 7 client-side operating systems, firmware, bare-metal servers for which we compile the OS (see TrustedServer), our own open-source VPN protocol Lightway, etc. No matter what your background, you're going to find someone from whom you can learn here. That makes for interesting conversations.\nCareer growth. We're lucky to be a leading company in a fast-growing industry. We're expanding the business and hiring many people, which brings many opportunities for you to evolve your role. You can rotate through teams and gain exposure to a broad range of challenges, or go into people-management. We value the individual contributor and people-management tracks equally.\n\n\nWhat would I be responsible for?\n\nYou'd be on a team with a well-defined goal. Your team-members are other engineers, and likely a few people from other functions like product management, data analysis, and design. You and your team decide what to do to achieve your goals.\n\nAs An Engineer, You're Expected To\n\nDo what's right for the company and our customers.\nExpress requirements as code. Otherwise known as \"good automated testing at all levels of the pyramid.\" We like TDD a lot.\nDesign, test, build and operate software.\nIf you're on a team that operates a service: you're also be expected to be on an on-call team, and your team is empowered to keep after-hours incidents below one per person per 3 months.\nHelp grow your colleagues. Inspire, mentor and coach.\nImprove yourself. Raise your skill-levels and bring new approaches to your team.\n\n\nYour success is measured by the pace and quality of the engineering solutions you deliver in your team. We define quality very broadly: it includes security, privacy, capacity, performance, reliability, cost-efficiency, etc.\n\nWhat do I need to succeed?\n\nTo Fit Into Our Company\n\nBe honest, most importantly with yourself.\nBe curious. Improve yourself constantly.\nBe open and value positive relationships with your colleagues.\n\n\nWe're open to hiring engineers from all levels of experience; we might be their first full-time job (we'll help you learn quickly), or they might be at the top of their field with 20+ years of professional experience (you might invent things like Lightway and directly impact millions of people).\n\nAlso, we're open to hiring engineers from a broad range of backgrounds, including but not limited to:\n\nMicroservices\nCloud infrastructure, both AWS as well as bare-metal.\nClient-side software in any operating system. We build apps for Windows, Mac, Android, iOS, Linux, Browser-Extensions, and routers/firmware.\nWeb UIs\nStress and performance engineering\nSecurity\nLinux system administration\nDrivers\nNetwork engineering\nData Engineering, Science, and Analysis\nand more.\n\n\nSounds interesting. What's next?\n\nLet's talk. Tell us what you're looking for in your dream job, then let's see what role would be a great fit for you.\n\nThe Steps Are\nGet in touch using the form below.\nOur engineering hiring-team will look at your profile and make a decision on whether to engage with you. If you write us a cover-letter, we will respond with a personal note regardless of our decision.\nAn in-house recruiter will set up a time to speak with you on video and prepare you for our interview process.\nOur interviews are then composed of:\na screening call with an engineering manager\nusually about 4 interviews with other engineers\neither a homework problem-solving exercise or a live pair-programming exercise.\nThen offer, including meet-and-greets with more colleagues.\nAs soon as feasible: reference checks with former managers and maybe other colleagues. Your hiring-manager will perform these calls, and we'll expect you to make the introductions. We realize that we might only be able to speak with your current manager after you've accepted our offer and resigned from your current position.\n\n\nThanks for your time, we look forward to hearing from you!\n\nHiring process\n\nWhen it comes to hiring processes, \u201crigorous\u201d and \u201copaque\u201d are often mistakenly conflated. For us, it\u2019s always a mutual exchange, so we think it\u2019s important that candidates have a clear understanding of the process and what we\u2019re looking for. Learn more about the hiring process by visiting our careers page.\n\nBenefits\n\nHealth and happiness go hand in hand, and we make every effort to support our team members in all facets of their lives\u2014both inside and outside the office. Learn more about our employee benefits by visiting our careers page.\n\nBefore you apply\n\nAt the moment, we do not sponsor visas in the UK and the EU. For Hong Kong, we require at least two years of working experience and a university degree in a related field. For Singapore, we can only sponsor visas for mid-career or above.\nPlease upload your resume as a PDF and do not include any salary or compensation information in it.\n\n\nExpressVPN is one of the world\u2019s leading providers of online privacy and security services for consumers.

Inspire, mentor and coach.</li><li>Improve yourself. Raise your skill-levels and bring new approaches to your team.<br>\n<br>\n</li></ul>Your success is measured by the <strong>pace and quality</strong> of the engineering solutions you deliver in your team. We define quality very broadly: it includes security, privacy, capacity, performance, reliability, cost-efficiency, etc.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>What do I need to succeed?<br>\n<br>\n</strong><strong>To Fit Into Our Company<br>\n</strong><ul><li>Be honest, most importantly with yourself.</li><li>Be curious. Improve yourself constantly.</li><li>Be open and value positive relationships with your colleagues.<br>\n<br>\n</li></ul>We're <strong>open to hiring</strong> engineers from <strong>all levels of experience</strong>; we might be their first full-time job (we'll help you learn quickly), or they might be at the top of their field with 20+ years of professional experience (you might invent things like Lightway and directly impact millions of people).<br>\n<br>\nAlso, we're <strong>open to hiring engineers from a broad range of backgrounds</strong>, including but not limited to:<br>\n<ul><li>Microservices</li><li>Cloud infrastructure, both AWS as well as bare-metal.</li><li>Client-side software in any operating system. We build apps for Windows, Mac, Android, iOS, Linux, Browser-Extensions, and routers/firmware.</li><li>Web UIs</li><li>Stress and performance engineering</li><li>Security</li><li>Linux system administration</li><li>Drivers</li><li>Network engineering</li><li>Data Engineering, Science, and Analysis</li><li>and more.<br>\n<br>\n</li></ul><strong>Sounds interesting. What's next?<br>\n<br>\n</strong>Let's talk. Tell us what you're looking for in your dream job, then let's see what role would be a great fit for you.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>The Steps Are</strong><ul><li>Get in touch using the form below.</li><li>Our engineering hiring-team will look at your profile and make a decision on whether to engage with you. If you write us a cover-letter, we will respond with a personal note regardless of our decision.</li><li>An in-house recruiter will set up a time to speak with you on video and prepare you for our interview process.</li><li>Our interviews are then composed of:</li><ul><li>a screening call with an engineering manager</li><li>usually about 4 interviews with other engineers</li><li>either a homework problem-solving exercise or a live pair-programming exercise.</li></ul><li>Then offer, including meet-and-greets with more colleagues.</li><li>As soon as feasible: reference checks with former managers and maybe other colleagues. Your hiring-manager will perform these calls, and we'll expect you to make the introductions. We realize that we might only be able to speak with your current manager after you've accepted our offer and resigned from your current position.<br>\n<br>\n</li></ul>Thanks for your time, we look forward to hearing from you!<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Hiring process<br>\n<br>\n</strong>When it comes to hiring processes, \u201crigorous\u201d and \u201copaque\u201d are often mistakenly conflated.

Learn more about the hiring process by visiting our careers page.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Benefits<br>\n<br>\n</strong>Health and happiness go hand in hand, and we make every effort to support our team members in all facets of their lives\u2014both inside and outside the office.

For Singapore, we can only sponsor visas for mid-career or above.</li><li>Please upload your resume as a PDF and do not include any salary or compensation information in it.<br>\n<br>\n</li></ul><i>ExpressVPN is one of the world\u2019s leading providers of online privacy and security services for consumers.

We tend to do less long-term, operational-type projects based at the client site, away from home.</li><li>An exceptional mix of experiences and opportunities spanning corporate strategy, the deals market and Asia wide exciting projects.</li><li>Huge opportunities for accelerated personal and professional growth, and a long term (global) career at PwC.<br>\n</li></ul><strong>Education </strong><i>(if blank, degree and/or field of study not specified)<br>\n<br>\n</i><strong><u>Degrees/Field Of Study Required<br>\n<br>\n</u></strong>Degrees/Field of Study preferred:<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Certifications </strong><i>(if blank, certifications not specified)<br>\n<br>\n</i><strong><u>Optional Skills<br>\n<br>\n</u></strong><strong>Required Skills<br>\n<br>\n</strong><strong>Desired Languages </strong><i>(If blank, desired languages not specified)<br>\n<br>\n</i><strong><u>Travel Requirements<br>\n<br>\n</u></strong>Not Specified<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Available for Work Visa Sponsorship?<br>\n<br>\n</strong>Yes<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Government Clearance Required?<br>\n<br>\n</strong>No<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Job Posting End Date</strong>\n        </span>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"jobs-description__details\">\n<!---->\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </article>\n<!----></div>",
